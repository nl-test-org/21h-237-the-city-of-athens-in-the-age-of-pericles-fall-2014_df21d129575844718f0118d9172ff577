Research Project
----------------

The research project will be on a topic of your own choosing, and will take the form of a written paper of 3,000 words (≈ 10 to 12 pages). Your research project will be expected to demonstrate the skills developed in your earlier writing assignments (i.e. close analysis of archaeological and literary evidence) as well as knowledge and understanding of as wide as possible a range of modern works relevant to your chosen topic.

To encourage the early research and formulation of ideas, you will each be required to submit a topic proposal by Session 16. The topic proposal will count for 10%; the final paper for 20%. The research project will be due at the start of our final session.
